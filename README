README for Jitterbug
--------------------

JitterBug - where do you want to dance today?

JitterBug is a cgi-bin tool for problem reporting and tracking developed
by Andrew Tridgell for the Samba Team. Samba (see http://samba.anu.edu.au)
generates a huge amount of incoming mail, being a mixture of bug reports,
suggestions, complaints and even compliments! 

JitterBug is distributed under the GNU Public Licence (see the file
COPYING in the same directory as this README file) without any warranties.
We have tried to make it as useful and secure as possible, but there are 
undoubtably some bugs lurking in here. 

To run JitterBug you need:

	- Some kind of vaguely Unix-like operating system. Ports to 
	  others should be quite easy, but haven't been done yet.

	- Ability to configure the web daemon and chmod +s one file.
	  You don't need to be root to administer Jitterbug once it is
	  set up only to get it installed. (note: it is possible to
	  run JitterBug without this but it is less secure!)

If you want to see some examples of what JitterBug can do then have a
look at http://samba.anu.edu.au/cgi-bin/jitterbug

Now go to the doc directory and read INSTALL.

Regards

The Samba Team
