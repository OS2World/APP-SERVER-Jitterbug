<H2>Sample JitterBug bug report submission</H2>

<p><b> NOTE: You need to customise this form for your own
purposes. Edit the file reportform.html in the data
directory. Additional Form variables used in this form should start
with opt_ for them to be automatically processed by JitterBug. You can
have as many form variables as you like of any type you like. See a
HTML book for details. </b><p>

<b>The only form variables that must be included are 'from', 'subject'
and 'body'. The others shown below are optional.</b> <p>

Note that when users submit messages via this form that the messages
are submitted via email into the system. This means they don't show up
in incoming immediately, they will show up when your mailer has
processed them (usually less than a minute unless you have a very slow
mailer). <p>


Please fill out the following fields as accurately as you can. Once
you submit your bug report it will be added to the end of the incoming
area.<p>

If you mark the message private then it will only be viewable by the
PACKAGE developers. Please do this if you include any confidential information
about your company. <p>
