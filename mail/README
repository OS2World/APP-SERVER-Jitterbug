Jitterbug Mail Processing
-------------------------

This directory contains an example of how to get JitterBug to place
different incoming messages into different JitterBug directories.

If you just want all messages to go into an "incoming" directory then
just use a .forward file of

	"|/path/to/new_message PACKAGE"

(the quotes are important)

To do something fancier you can use procmail to select what messages
go where. Copy the sample forward file to ~/.forward and the
procmailrc file to ~/.procmailrc. Edit to suit.

The new_message program takes an optional second argument which
specifies which JitterBug directory to put messages in. In the example
given in procmailrc CVS commit messages are automatically put into the
CVS JitterBug directory.
